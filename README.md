## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React 19** with TypeScript
- **Next.js 15** for server-side rendering and routing
- **React Query** for data fetching, caching, and state management
- **Recharts** for interactive data visualization
- **Tailwind CSS** with shadcn/ui components for styling

### Backend & Infrastructure
- **Next.js API Routes** for serverless API endpoints
- **Redis** (Upstash) for distributed caching
- **API middlewares** for rate limiting, logging, and security
- **CoinGecko API** integration for cryptocurrency data
- **TypeScript** for type safety throughout the codebase

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18.x or higher
- npm or yarn
- [Optional] Upstash Redis account for caching

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/JacksonLee45/crypto-dashboard-1.git
cd crypto-dashboard
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

3. Set up environment variables
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add:
```
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=your_redis_url
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your_redis_token
```

4. Run the development server
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### API Layer Architecture

The application follows a multi-layered API architecture:

1. **Client Request** ‚Üí Enters the application 2. **Middleware Layer**
   - Request parsing and validation
   - IP-based rate limiting
   - Request ID generation and propagation
   - Security headers application
3. **API Route Handler**
   - Cache check and retrieval
   - External API calls (if needed)
   - Data transformation and normalization
   - Response formatting
4. **Cache Management Layer**
   - TTL-based cache strategies
   - Fallback mechanisms
   - Background refresh patterns

### Caching Strategy

The application employs a sophisticated caching strategy:

- **Short-lived cache** (60s) for volatile data like current prices
- **Medium-lived cache** (5min) for market overviews and listings
- **Long-lived cache** (30min) for historical data and infrequently changing information
- **Very long-lived cache** (6h) for static content like coin descriptions

Each cache strategy is implemented with appropriate TTL values and includes:
- Automatic cache invalidation
- Graceful handling of cache misses
- Request tracing through cache operations

### Rate Limiting Implementation

All API endpoints are protected by a Redis-based rate limiting system:
- IP address tracking for identifying clients
- Sliding window algorithm for accurate tracking
- Different rate limits based on endpoint resource requirements
- Clear rate limit headers for client feedback
